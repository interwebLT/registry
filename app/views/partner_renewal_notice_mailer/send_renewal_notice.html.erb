<p>
We urge you to contact your clients in order to renew their registrations. Failure to renew the domain before expiry will cause all Web and Mail service to be disabled. This means that their Website will be down and they will be unable to receive e-mail.
</p>

<p>Please help us to ensure that their services remain uninterrupted by getting them to renew as soon as possible.</p>

<p>
You may renew the domains on behalf of your clients by logging into your registrar account at 
<a href="https://partner.dot.ph"> https://partner.dot.ph</a>.
</p>

<p>Once you are logged in, click on the domain you want to renew and follow the instructions online.</p>

<p>For inquiries or further clarification, please contact us at helpdesk@dot.ph.</p>
