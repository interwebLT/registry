<p>Dear <%= @partner.name %>,</p>

<p>Please be informed that registration for the ff. domain/s has been expired.</p>

<table class="table table-striped table-condensed">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Domain Name</th>
      <th>Expiry Date</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <% @domains.each do |domain| %>
      <tr>
        <td><%= domain.name %></td>
        <td><%= domain.expires_at.strftime("%m/%d/%Y") %></td>
      </tr>
    <% end %>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The domain/s are now deactivated and all web and mail services associated with the domain/s have been disabled.</p>

<p>
We urge you to contact your clients in order to renew their registrations at the soonest possible time. In the event that the domains are not renewed, they will be deleted from the database. This means that the domain/s will again be available for registration by any interested parties.
